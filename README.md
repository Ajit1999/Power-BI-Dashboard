# Power-BI-Dashboard


Microsoftâ€™s Power BI is a business and data analytics service that enables professionals to process, analyze, and visualize vast volumes of data. It helps extract insights, draw conclusions, and share results in the form of reports and dashboards across various departments. It provides an easy drag and drops feature with a range of interactive data visualizations to generate reports and dashboards.


Power BI dashboards are single-page documents, often referred to as canvas, which illustrate a story through visualizations. A well-designed dashboard consists only of the highlights of a story. This is due to the fact that it is limited to one page. For more information, readers can view related reports. Power BI is the only service that offers dashboards. A single page visualization with multiple charts and graphs to tell a story is called a Power BI dashboard. This one-page visualization in a dashboard is also known as a Canvas. The Power BI dashboard is a feature only available in Power BI Service. Since a Power BI dashboard is limited to one page, it only contains the highlights of a story. You cannot create a dashboard on Power BI Desktop.
