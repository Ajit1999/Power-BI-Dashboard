This Dashboard is about E-commerce sales from 2011 to 2013. The raw dataset describes the order ID, order date, shipping date, shipping mode, customer id & name. Details about city, state, country & market. Also details about a product, their category/subcategory, sales, discount, shipping cost, profit, priority & quantity.
There are multiples of null values present in the raw dataset. Use power query for data cleaning, and data analysis & create a new column to find order delivery days. I have used Data Cleaning, transforming and modeling the data, Calculated Columns, Working on Power Queries, and Created charts and graphs while making this dashboard. Inside the dashboard use slicer, cards, pie chart, donut chart, line chart & bar chart. 
This dashboard helps to find the Sales, Profit, Quantity, Average Delivery Days, total return order, and total order count. Also, it helps to find sales in different markets or different categories like technology, furniture, etc. Also, it helps to find sales by segment. Similarly, it helps to calculate return orders by the market like EU, APAC, US etc.
It is very useful to create a new marketing strategy, find a strong customer base, profitable market, and profitable product.
