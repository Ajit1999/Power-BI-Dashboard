This Dashboard is about superstore sales from 2012 to 2015. The raw dataset describes the order ID, order date, shipping date, shipping mode, customer id & name. Details about city, state, country & market. Also details about a product, their category/subcategory, sales, discount, shipping cost, profit, priority & quantity.
There are multiple null values present in the raw dataset. Use power query for data cleaning, and data analysis & create a new column to find order delivery days & years. I have used Data Cleaning, transforming and modeling the data, Calculated Columns, Working on Power Queries, and Created charts and graphs while making this dashboard. Inside the dashboard use slicer, cards, pie chart, donut chart, line chart & bar chart. 
This dashboard helps to find the Sales, Quantity, Average Delivery Days, and total return order. Also, it helps to find sales in different markets and different segments. Similarly, it helps to find the top 10 customers, top 5 profitable products & top 5 nonprofitable products.
It is very useful to create a new marketing strategy, find a strong customer base, a profitable market,  profitable and nonprofitable products.
