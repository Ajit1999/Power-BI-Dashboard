This Dashboard is about Walmart's sales performance in the United States from 2011 to 2014. The raw dataset describes the ID, customer id & name, shipping date, order date, city, state, also details about a product, its category/subcategory, sales, discount, shipping cost, profit, priority & quantity.
There are multiple null values present in the raw dataset. Use power query for data cleaning, and data analysis. I have used Data Cleaning, transforming and modeling the data, Calculated Columns, Working on Power Queries, and Created charts and graphs while making this dashboard. Inside the dashboard use slicer, cards, pie chart, donut chart, line chart & bar chart. 
This dashboard helps to find the Sales, total orders, average rating, profit, delivery days.  Also, it helps to find sales by different states, profit by city, product and its average profit.
It is very useful to create a new marketing strategy, find a strong customer base, a profitable market,  profitable and nonprofitable products.
